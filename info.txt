EXPERIENCE
Research Associate, Ractigen Therapeutics
June 2024 - Present

Developed a transformer model to predict optimal modifications to saRNA drug test articles for maximizing activity increases, enabling computational screening that reduced research costs and facilitated novel discoveries
Streamlined high-throughput screening (HTS) data processing for siRNA drugs, designing a computational screening pipeline combining molecular docking and deep learning. Enhanced drug advancement rate from secondary screening to hit validation by over 10%
Deployed and managed AWS instances to harness cloud computing resources, optimizing scalability and processing capacity for high-throughput analyses. Demonstrated expertise in EC2, S3, and IAM for secure data storage, computation, and resource allocation.
Resolved persistent errors in high-throughput screening (HTS) machines by developing a custom error-handling application using OpenCV. Designed as a macro solution for light cyclers, the application automated error detection and recovery, significantly increasing research throughput and ensuring seamless operation across the HTS group

Computational Biology Intern, Digestiva
February 2023 - Present

Developed a cross-attention peptide classification model utilizing ESM2-generated features to classify peptides from the Peptipedia dataset, enabling efficient screening of protease activity. Accelerated discovery of new applications by streamlining peptide analysis for expanded use cases
Collaborated closely with wet lab researchers by providing computational predictions that prioritized peptide candidates, both reducing screening time and research costs.
